# Unicode Emoji for Pidgin

This repository is a fork of [Steffen Vogel's emoji][1] set.  The original project supported iOS color emoji, and ttf monochrome emoji from old Android and Symbola sets.  This fork provides an updated, complete color emoji set as used by Hangouts, and a set used by Twitter.

These Smilies can easily be used in Pidgin by copying the folder to ~/.purple/smileys

Please note that every smiley maps to his dedicated unicode character as specified by Unicode 6.0.
This enables interoperability with Android & iOS chat clients.
